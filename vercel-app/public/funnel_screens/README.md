# Funnel step hover images

Hovering over each conversion funnel step shows a tooltip with an app screen screenshot.

Add one PNG per step with these **exact filenames**:

| Step | Filename |
|------|----------|
| Signed up | `signed_up.png` |
| KYC completed | `kyc_completed.png` |
| Credit check completed | `credit_check.png` |
| Plan creation | `plan_creation.png` |
| Initial collection | `initial_collection.png` |

Place the files in this folder (`public/funnel_screens/`). Each image is shown in the hover tooltip; use app screenshots that match each step (e.g. signup screen, KYC screen, plan screen, payment screen).
